abstract = {The transcriptome contains rich information on molecular, cellular and organismal phenotypes. However, experimental and statistical limitations constrain sensitivity and throughput of genetic screening with single-cell transcriptomics readout. To overcome these limitations, we introduce targeted Perturb-seq (TAP-seq), a sensitive, inexpensive and platform-independent method focusing single-cell RNA-seq coverage on genes of interest, thereby increasing the sensitivity and scale of genetic screens by orders of magnitude. TAP-seq permits routine analysis of thousands of CRISPR-mediated perturbations within a single experiment, detects weak effects and lowly expressed genes, and decreases sequencing requirements by up to 50-fold. We apply TAP-seq to generate perturbation-based enhancer–target gene maps for 1,778 enhancers within 2.5{\%} of the human genome. We thereby show that enhancer–target association is jointly determined by three-dimensional contact frequency and epigenetic states, allowing accurate prediction of enhancer targets throughout the genome. In addition, we demonstrate that TAP-seq can identify cell subtypes with only 100 sequencing reads per cell.},

@article{Sarkar2020,
abstract = {How to model and analyze scRNA-seq data has been the subject of considerable confusion and debate. The high proportion of zero counts in a typical scRNA-seq data matrix has garnered particular attention, and lead to widespread but inconsistent use of terminology such as "dropout" and "missing data." Here, we argue that much of this terminology is unhelpful and confusing, and outline simple ways of thinking about models for scRNA-seq data that can help avoid this confusion. The key ideas are: (1) observed scRNA-seq counts reflect both the actual expression level of each gene in each cell and the measurement process, and it is important for models to explicitly distinguish contributions from these two distinct factors; and (2) the measurement process can be adequately described by a simple Poisson model, a claim for which we provide both theoretical and empirical support. We show how these ideas lead to a simple, flexible statistical framework that encompasses a number of commonly used models and analysis methods, and how this framework makes explicit their different assumptions and helps interpret their results. We also illustrate how explicitly separating models for expression and measurement can help address questions of biological interest, such as whether mRNA expression levels are multi-modal among cells.},

We evaluated 36 approaches using experimental and synthetic data and found considerable differences in the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Prefiltering of lowly expressed genes has important effects, particularly for some of the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data analysis. However, we found that bulk RNA-seq analysis methods do not generally perform worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq. We also present conquer, a repository of consistently processed, analysis-ready public scRNA-seq data sets that is aimed at simplifying method evaluation and reanalysis of published results.

abstract = {The thousands of disease risk genes and loci identified through human genetic studies far outstrip our current capacity to systematically study their functions. New experimental approaches are needed for functional investigations of large panels of genes in a biologically relevant context. Here, we developed a scalable genetic screen approach, in vivo Perturb-Seq, and applied this method to the functional evaluation of 35 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) de novo loss-of-function risk genes. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we introduced frameshift mutations in these risk genes in pools, within the developing brain in utero, and then performed single-cell RNA-Seq in the postnatal brain. We identified cell type-specific gene signatures from both neuronal and glial cell classes that are affected by genetic perturbations and pointed at elements of both convergent and divergent cellular effects across this cohort of ASD risk genes. In vivo Perturb-Seq pioneers a systems genetics approach to investigate at scale how diverse mutations affect cell types and states in the biologically relevant context of the developing organism.},

abstract = {Read counting and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting are the principal gene expression quantification schemes used in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. By using multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we reveal distinct distribution differences between these schemes and conclude that the negative binomial model is a good approximation for UMI counts, even in heterogeneous populations. We further propose a novel differential expression analysis algorithm based on a negative binomial model with independent dispersions in each group (NBID). Our results show that this properly controls the FDR and achieves better power for UMI counts when compared to other recently developed packages for scRNA-seq analysis.},

High-content phenotyping approaches such as Perturb-seq (single-cell RNA-sequencing pooled CRISPR screens) present an opportunity for exploring such genetic interactions (GIs) at scale. Here, we present an analytical framework for interpreting high-dimensional landscapes of cell states (manifolds) constructed from transcriptional phenotypes. We applied this approach to Perturb-seq profiling of strong GIs mined from a growth-based, gain-of-function GI map. Exploration of this manifold enabled ordering of regulatory pathways, principled classification of GIs (e.g., identifying suppressors), and mechanistic elucidation of synergistic interactions, including an unexpected synergy between CBL and CNN1 driving erythroid differentiation. Finally, we applied recommender system machine learning to predict interactions, facilitating exploration of vastly larger GI manifolds.},

@article{Wang2019e,
abstract = {Background: The analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. scRNAseq data, however, are highly heterogeneous and have a large number of zero counts, which introduces challenges in detecting DE genes. Addressing these challenges requires employing new approaches beyond the conventional ones, which are based on a nonzero difference in average expression. Several methods have been developed for differential gene expression analysis of scRNAseq data. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to evaluate and compare the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods for scRNAseq data. Results: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of eleven differential gene expression analysis software tools, which are designed for scRNAseq data or can be applied to them. We used simulated and real data to evaluate the accuracy and precision of detection. Using simulated data, we investigated the effect of sample size on the detection accuracy of the tools. Using real data, we examined the agreement among the tools in identifying DE genes, the run time of the tools, and the biological relevance of the detected DE genes. Conclusions: In general, agreement among the tools in calling DE genes is not high. There is a trade-off between true-positive rates and the precision of calling DE genes. Methods with higher true positive rates tend to show low precision due to their introducing false positives, whereas methods with high precision show low true positive rates due to identifying few DE genes. We observed that current methods designed for scRNAseq data do not tend to show better performance compared to methods designed for bulk RNAseq data. Data multimodality and abundance of zero read counts are the main characteristics of scRNAseq data, which play important roles in the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods and need to be considered in terms of the development of new methods.},

abstract = {Over one million candidate regulatory elements have been identified across the human genome, but nearly all are unvalidated and their target genes uncertain. Approaches based on human genetics are limited in scope to common variants and in resolution by linkage disequilibrium. We present a multiplex, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-inspired framework for mapping enhancer-gene pairs by introducing random combinations of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbations to each of many cells, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell transcriptomes. We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D conformational proximity to their target genes. This framework will facilitate the large-scale mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, a critical yet largely uncharted component of the cis-regulatory landscape of the human genome.},

By leveraging biobank-scale GWAS data, massively parallel CRISPR screens and single cell transcriptome sequencing, we discovered target genes of noncoding variants for blood trait loci. The closest gene was often the target gene, but this was not always the case. We also identified trans-effects networks of noncoding variants when cis target genes encoded transcription factors, such as GFI1B and NFE2. We observed that GFI1B trans-target genes were enriched for GFI1B binding sites and fine-mapped GWAS variants, and expressed in human bone marrow progenitor cells, suggesting that GFI1B acts as a master regulator of blood traits.
