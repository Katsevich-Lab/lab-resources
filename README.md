# Katsevich Lab Resources

This is a collection of computational resources for Katsevich lab members. Please head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Katsevich-Lab/lab-resources/wiki) to read more. For those who are not lab members, I've made this repository public in case you would benefit from it.
